Bluehole encrypted packets after 3.7.19.

I will not provide decryption method in this fork, __this is not a "Ready to work" source code.__ I only update some features and UI staffs here.(It's not me figured out how to decrypt, I just copy and paste from Internet.)


# About
Big thanks to [@AiYinZiLeGong](https://github.com/AiYinZiLeGong) [@Jerry1211](https://github.com/Jerry1211) and [@SamuelNZ](https://github.com/SamuelNZ). Everthing here is based on their work.

I'm not a prof. programmer, just a noob learns to code. I even don't know the difference between _val_ and _var_. So feel free to optimize my shitty code.

And this is a very personal programme based on my usage habit, so I don't have the ability to solve all your problems or requests. But you can get help from [here](https://github.com/AiYinZiLeGong/PUBG-Radar/issues).
